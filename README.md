#T01_TheToysApp

Finished the lessons. App is complete. Learnt usage of another Java module, ScrollViews, and that stuff can be added to a TextView along with escape sequence characters using the + (concatenation) operator. I can make some decent stuff now.

Lessons covered: T01.01, T01.02, T01.03.
